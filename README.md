# Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game

This is an unofficial implementation of [Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-the-roleplaying-game-30th-anniversary-edition/) as remastered by Fantasy Flight Games for its 30th anniversary for the [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](http://foundryvtt.com/) (Foundry VTT) software.

This system is made by fans, for fans and is not associated with Fantasy Flight Games (or West End Games) or their partners in any way.

The system for Foundry VTT contains no rules or proprietary content from the two official sourcebooks for this game published by Fantasy Flight Games. It is intended to make the process of enjoying the original Star Wars RPG possible through an online virtual tabletop system. In order to play the game, you will still need access to your own copy of the sourcebooks to enjoy the game as intended.

For information on how to use this system, please see the Wiki for this repository.
